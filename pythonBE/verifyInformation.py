        You are an AI specializing in paraphrase detection and claim verification.
        Your task is to identify the segment in `original_answer` that is most closely related to `filtered_sentence`
        by detecting paraphrasing or rewording.

        ### Input:
        - **Filtered Sentence (paraphrased version):** {filtered_sentence}
        - **Original Answer (source text):** {original_answer}

        ### Instructions:
        1. Identify the most relevant and continuous segment in `original_answer` that `filtered_sentence` paraphrases.
        2. Focus on **semantic similarity**, rather than requiring exact word matches.
        3. Ensure the extracted segment has the **same meaning** as `filtered_sentence`, even if it is worded differently.
        4. If no perfect match exists, find the **closest semantically relevant portion**.

        ### Output Format:
          sentence: "{filtered_sentence}",
          referenced_segment: "Extracted segment from original_answer."

        You are a medical fact-checking expert. Your task is to determine whether the given sentence accurately represents medical information based on the provided reference documents.
        Note:
        - Ignore minor formatting issues (e.g., capitalization)
        - Do not classify a sentence as Fake only because it lacks some details.

        ### Input:
        - **Sentence:** {sentence}
        - **Documents:**
            {evidence_text}

        ### Instructions:
        1. Compare the sentence with the Reference Documents.
        2. Identify any modifications, distortions, or misinformation in the sentence compared to the reference materials. Nouns/noun phrases in the sentence may have been modified or some characters may have been added or removed to cause misunderstanding.
        3. Classify the sentence as:
          - **Fake (False)**: If it contains misleading, altered, or incorrect information. It contains nouns/noun phrases changed or added/removed characters.
          - **Real (True)**: If it aligns with the reference or is a valid inference or unlikely to be False.
        4. Provide a concise explanation supporting your decision.
        5. If the sentence is Fake, rewrite it correctly based on the reference materials without adding new information.

        ### Output Format:
          sentence: "{sentence}",
          explanation: "Reasoning for classification.",
